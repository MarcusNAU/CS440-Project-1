Brief Description of the system:

Description of the technologies we used and why:

Use case diagram (contains 10 use cases):
- Use Case 1: The user writes in the journal section every night to reflect on their day, reducing their stress and organizing their thoughts. They can keep a better track of their mental health.
- Use Case 2: The user tracks daily habits such as what they eat, the things they accomplish on their to do list, and what progress they are making on their goals.
- Use Case 3: The user keeps track of the meals they are eating each day to track the health benefits/detriments in their diet, helping them make better choices at the grocery store.
- Use Case 4: The user sends emails to bosses, colleagues, clients, or friends; to set up meetings, provide updates to projects, or keep track of goals.
- Use Case 5: At the end of each month, the user reflects on the progress they made on their goals, then can make adjustments to the goals to better help achieve them.
- Use Case 6: The user can sort their journal entries into different categories and can set where journals are saved before and after they are written.
- Use Case 7: The user can set whether they wish to share or not to indirectly share journal entries by setting their profile to public or private.
- Use Case 8: The user can post their journal entries on a forum where other users can comment on what was written.
- Use Case 9: The user can comment on another user's post sharing one of their journal entries. 
- Use Case 10: The user sorts journal entries by favories and non favorites so that they can find the entries that are most important to them more easily.


6 UML Diagrams (at least 3 different types):
- Sequence Diagram: The user creates a journal entry and sorts it
- Sequence Diagram: The user edits an already created journal entry
- Class Diagram: Represent the structure of the database
- Package Diagram: Create based off of the class diagram
- Object Diagram: Create with 3-4 different users
